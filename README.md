### How to Play
Left-click on a square to uncover it.
Right-click on a square to flag it as a mine.
If a square is a mine, the game is over. If all the squares without mines are uncovered, you win!
The number in a square indicates the number of mines in the surrounding squares.


## Getting Started 
https://github.com/mynameisfaatimah/Minesweeper


## My plan
- Desgin the gameboard with a grid os squares and randomly set a number of mines in the grid within JS

- Create functionlity to uncover squares, flag them as mines and display the number of mines in the surrounding squares. 

- Create logiuc to determine if the player has lost the game by uncovering a mine  or if they have won by uncovering all the squares without mines. 

- Add user interactions: left-click to uncover a cell,right-click to flag/unflag it as a mine, and display game status messages. 

- console.log along the way and be sure to commit gits to track progress
